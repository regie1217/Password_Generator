# Password Generator

## Description
For this project, I wanted to help employees protect sensitive data. The problem that this solves is data security. By developing a password generator employees can prevent hackers from accessing sensitive information. From building this, I learned more about javascript programming especially when it comes to storing user input and accessing it by using functions.

## Usage
The usage of this is straightforward. First you have to pick a length for the password. After that you can check the criteria that you want to be included in your password. The last step would be to click the generate password button and it would generate a password for you. If you do not like the password that it generated, you can just click the button again and it will generate a new password.
